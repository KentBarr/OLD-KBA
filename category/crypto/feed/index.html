<p>I believe you&#8217;re looking at the future (today!) of commerce for everyone, *particularly* for people who make things and want to sell them to customers that want to buy them without any hassles from rip-off distributors, evil payment processors (looking at <em>you</em> PayPal), and greedy and demanding government assholes with their regulations, their fees, their fines, and their general slobbering insistence that you owe them for something they had NOTHING to do with.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><strong>Notes On The Infinity Computer</strong></h4>
<p>I see a disturbing lack of comprehension of what is happening, even among those that pride themselves of some (vague) knowledge of The Blockchain, as if just being aware that Bitcoin is a thing gives them some sort of higher power not accessible by the sheeple.</p>
<p>I see people priding themselves and bragging about getting up early and shuffling their cryptos around to momentary advantage as if the whole point of a distributed ledger was to open up new frontiers of Day Trading currency speculation. There&#8217;s an entire publication dedicated to the notion at <a href="http://cointelegraph.com/" target="_blank">Cointelegraph</a> just for example. Shit like that is a temple for the worship of Wrong. People that think the purpose of life is to be the early bird and acquire the worm to the disadvantage of all the other birds will be replaced by digital birds that not only never sleep, they keep a sharp eye out for motherfuckers like that.</p>
<p>I see mind-bendingly powerful computers for sale for 15 USD. Ok, they&#8217;re only mind-bendingly powerful to us old guys who remember what kind of computers took us to the fucking moon. That&#8217;s right, Jack, you couldn&#8217;t play <em>Angry Birds</em> on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer" target="_blank">Apollo Guidance Computer</a>.</p>
<p>I see the development of memory and registers operating in <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/semiconductors/design/the-computer-chip-that-never-forgets" target="_blank">picoseconds</a> .</p>
<p>I see vast storage capable of lasting near enough to forever as makes no difference to <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/a19459/is-a-quartz-hard-drive-the-first-immortal-storage-medium/capable" target="_blank">mortal men</a>.</p>
<p>I see distributed cryptographically secure <a href="https://diasporafoundation.org/" target="_blank">p2p networks</a>.</p>
<p>I see open source distributed processing of <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/" target="_blank">insane amounts</a> of data.</p>
<p>I see <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>.</p>
<p>Yeah, people see money&#8230; but *I* see&#8230; the INFINITY COMPUTER. It is everywhere and it is nowhere. Anyone can use it, nobody can control or stop it and it is happening right fucking now.</p>
<p>More to come on this topic.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring is sprung and a young man&#8217;s thoughts turn to&#8230; who are we kidding? Like they weren&#8217;t all winter. Horny fuckers. Anyway it turns OLD men&#8217;s thoughts to disturbing daydreams of violence and destruction, often involving robots. It&#8230; it makes us pretty goddamn cranky.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-720" src="http://kentbarrett.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture-1.jpg" alt="Capture" width="736" height="367" srcset="https://kentbarrett.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture-1.jpg 736w, https://kentbarrett.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://kentbarrett.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture-1-100x50.jpg 100w, https://kentbarrett.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture-1-150x75.jpg 150w, https://kentbarrett.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture-1-200x100.jpg 200w, https://kentbarrett.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture-1-450x224.jpg 450w, https://kentbarrett.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture-1-600x299.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" /></p>
<p>But, what can a cranky old man do?<em> Lacking</em> hordes of fucking robots, not much. Try to build some, I guess.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s start with one of these:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-716" src="http://kentbarrett.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture.jpg" alt="Capture" width="732" height="433" srcset="https://kentbarrett.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture.jpg 732w, https://kentbarrett.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture-300x177.jpg 300w, https://kentbarrett.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture-100x59.jpg 100w, https://kentbarrett.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture-150x89.jpg 150w, https://kentbarrett.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture-200x118.jpg 200w, https://kentbarrett.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture-450x266.jpg 450w, https://kentbarrett.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Capture-600x355.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px" /><br />
It&#8217;s a Pine 64. These 64 bit computer boards start at 15 bucks. You can order them with more ram and various doo-dads.</p>
<p>http://pine64.com/</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s possible to build world-destroying robots out of these, but they do run Linux so we know they&#8217;ll make fine servers or nodes for Ethereum, Dash, MaidSafe, OpenBazaar, etc.</p>
<p>I ordered one in April. The back-order situation is ongoing, due to the vast response on Kickstarter, but the boards are shipping and I&#8217;m hoping it won&#8217;t be too long a wait.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll post about the thing when it arrives and let you know how it goes. Until then,</p>
<p>Be well, fly low, stay cranky.</p>

<h4>Scott Duncan Quote of the Day</h4>
<p>1: THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER = THIS NOTE IS A TENDER FOR LAW.</p>
<p>2: ALL LAW IS PROHIBITIVE. You are buying this law to PROHIBIT OTHERS from infringing on YOUR RIGHT<span class="text_exposed_show">S, and now YOUR SERVANTS are claiming THEY have authority over YOU, because &#8220;they do all the housework&#8221;; Yes, they are your maid, but they PRESUME to be your WIFE.

<p><span class="text_exposed_show"><br />
3: You PAID a bunch of SERVANTS under SPECIFICALLY DEFINED RULES, and your &#8220;MAID&#8221; now thinks it has the same &#8220;rights&#8221; as a SPOUSE. To drive the point home, your SERVANTS demand a LICENCE to marry&#8230;</span></p>

<div data-theme-name="idea-content">
<div class="idea-summary" data-content="what">
<div>1) <em><strong>Cease borrowing fiat money from private banks at once.</strong></em></div>
<div></div>
<div>2) Inform Newfoundlanders that they have the <em><strong>right  </strong></em>to <strong><em>discharge public debt</em> </strong>via the <em><strong>Security of the Person</strong></em>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>3) Create a <strong>blockchain-based</strong> Newfoundland <strong>cryptocurrency</strong> and require its use for all government activities.</div>
<div></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">a) An application can easily be developed that Newoundlanders (or anyone) can run on their<strong> cell phones and home computers</strong>.</div>
<div></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">b) The application running on over a million processors will maintain the network and <strong>secure </strong>the blockchain.</div>
<div></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">c) Anyone who runs the application will <strong>receive income</strong> based on their participation, via transaction fees and &#8220;mining&#8221;. Co-incidentally, the mining system could <strong>do real work</strong> for the community such as solve problems for engineering departments around the province, do health care analysis, model fisheries, etc. etc. etc.</div>
<div></div>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">d) Government tenders and fulfillment can be moved to the <strong>public ledger</strong>, <em>eliminating most common forms of fraud and waste</em>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>4) Show other provinces/cities/countries how to do <em>exactly the same thing</em>.</div>
<div></div>
</div>
<h4 data-content="why-heading">Why this is important:</h4>
<div class="idea-summary" data-content="why">
<p>Newfoundlanders must stop paying billions of dollars of interest on fiat money that private banks conjure from thin air, take command of their own resources and become a world leader in the advancement of equitable, fraud-free financial technology for the benefit of everyone.</p>
